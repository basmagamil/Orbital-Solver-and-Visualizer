# Orbital-Solver-and-Visualizer

## How To Run
- You will find attached to this manual ten .m files and one .fig file. Eight .m files are
functions that are being used in the main code. The main GUI code is “gui_total_2.m” and
its .fig file.</br>
- Place all the attached files in the same folder and set it as your path directory in Matlab.
Run the “gui_total_2.m” file.</br>
- From the radio button group on the top left corner, you need to choose your preferred
input method.</br>
1) For direct r and v vectors, input the vector in this form “rx ry rz” and “vx vy vz” replacing
these symbols with your values and discarding the quotation marks of course.</br>
2) For orbital elements input method, you need to input all your elements in the specified
boxes, then click “calculate r & v” button.</br>
3) For the two line element method, you need to input the two line element set in the text
box, then click “calculate r & v” button.</br>
- Then enter the desired time of propagation in the text box on the bottom right corner,
and click on the pushbutton that says “Plot using the numerical method” or “Plot using
Kepler’s equation” based on your preference.</br>
- The window will close and a new window with the plot will appear. The satellite will
propagate for the specified time, then it will stop and the final r and v vectors will appear
on the graph.</br>
